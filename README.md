Example 2:
```
itay@Itay-PC:~$ python3 chatgpt.py "explain how insects breath"

Insects have a system of internal tubes that transport air throughout their bodies called tracheae. These tracheae open to the outside through small holes called spiracles that are located along the insect's body. Oxygen enters the spiracles and travels through the tracheae to reach the insect's cells. Carbon dioxide, which is created during respiration, is removed from the insect's body in the same way, through the spiracles and tracheae. This system is very efficient and allows insects to easily breathe without the need for lungs.
